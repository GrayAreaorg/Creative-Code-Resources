#**CREATIVE CODE IMMERSIVE**

Gray Area’s Creative Code Immersive is a education program focused on giving a small cohort of students a strong foundation in the art of creative code. Each week, our resident instructors guide participants through a sequence of topics that are designed to both lead to mastery of core techniques and strengthen students’ professional practice in the field of art and technology.
